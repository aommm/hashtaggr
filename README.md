spotifyapp
==========
A spotify app built on Socket.io and something else.

Server
------
In the /server directory: install dependencies using npm install, and start the server using node index.js.

Client
------
The client is not actually a real spotify app yet, but it's getting there!
For now, visit client/index.html in <a href="http://getfirefox.com">your browser of choice</a> to experience awesome server interaction.
